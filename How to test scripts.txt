This is how you can manually test our scripted inputs.

Prerequisites:
1. Make sure 'splunk' is in your $PATH.
2. Make sure you've read and understood our README.md

Test the scripts by opening up a terminal and locating the 'bin' folder of this app, which could be located at:
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunkgit/bin

To test our git repository data type:
  splunk cmd ./fetch_git_repo_data.sh

To test the github data type:
  splunk cmd python fetch_github_data.py
